## Rock Paper Scissors simulator 

This project strives to develop an understanding of the new technologies added in scala 3 as a tech demo.

Here I will program a simulation, where three groups of entities are spawned:
 - scissors
 - rocks
 - papers

The rules are:
 - scissors convert papers to scissors
 - papers convert rocks to papers
 - rocks convert scissors to rocks

When there remains only one type of entity on the board the simulation is considered finished.
